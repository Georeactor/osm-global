# osm-global

I have been working with freelance translators in Dhivehi, Somali, Burmese, and other underserved languages to translate the
OpenStreetMap homepage map and About page.

For Dhivehi (and eventually others) I have requested an additional 1,100 words
across the OpenStreetMap registration, login, password reset, and mapping process, as well as common iD editor UI and preset
words.  Dhivehi was a particular interest for me because the Thaana script was not being used in labels in the Maldives,
even as a bilingual option, though it is now supported by most renderers.

This repo serves as a 'global' repo for the multiple translations.  Also it offers the basic set of translations which you
can use to make the biggest impact in your language.

## Call for assistance

If you can verify existing translations for Dhivehi, Somali, or Burmese, please contact me ( NDoiron mapmeld com ).

Translations for Dhivehi have been waiting months for approval before they can be added to the OpenStreetMap site.

## Translation process

Unlike WikiMedia, the OpenStreetMap Foundation has no central effort around translation and representation. The OpenStreetMap
website language is crowdsourced on TranslateWiki, and iD Editor is crowdsourced on Transifex.

I personally believe that *TranslateWiki makes it difficult to commission translations or to organize volunteer translators*.
When I submit a translation for the website, it cannot appear until a second account has approved it, and there is no marking
for official translators. A volunteer who registers will be asked to make some unrelated translations. Then those translations are manually reviewed before
real edits or approvals can be made.  This process takes 24+ hours, so it is difficult to hold a 'translate-a-thon' or send
a quick sign-up link to volunteers... they have to be committed to follow a task and return to the site later on.

## Wins

* made layout for iD Editor and right-to-left languages
* fixed bug on the About page affecting all right-to-left languages
* Dhivehi translations appear in iD Editor (put "dv" in your user preferences languages)
* Maldives orgs are interested in using OpenStreetMap and Thaana script more
* mock-up maps to explain process in other languages
